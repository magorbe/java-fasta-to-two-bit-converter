The project was created using Eclipse.  

The other executable included with the source is edu.uncc.bioinformatics.Fast2BitCompare.  This command works as follows:

<code> 
java -classpath $libs_included_in_trunk:$project_classpath edu.uncc.bioinformatics.Fast2BitCompare /path/to/fasta1@/path/to/fasta2@/path/to/fasta3 twobit.2bit
</code>

The command will check the two files have equivalent data.

There are other tests included with the source for validation.
